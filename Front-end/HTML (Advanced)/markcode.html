<!-- If the formatting (white space, new lines, indentation) of the code matters, use
the pre element in combination with the code element: -->
<pre>
 <code>
 x = 42
 if x == 42:
 print "x is … … 42"
 </code>
</pre>
<!-- You still have to escape characters with special meaning in HTML (like < with
&lt;), so for displaying a block of HTML code (
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
), it could look like this: -->
<pre>
 <code>
 &lt;p>This is a paragraph.&lt;/p>
 </code>
</pre>
<!-- If a sentence contains computer code (for example, the name of an HTML element), use the code element to mark it
up: -->
<p>The <code>a</code> element creates a hyperlink.</p>
