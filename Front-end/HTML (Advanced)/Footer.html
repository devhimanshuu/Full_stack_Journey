Avoid unnecessary usage
<footer>
  elements may have a list of links to other parts of the site (FAQ, T&C, etc.).
  The footer element alone is sufficient in this case, you don't need to further
  wrap your links with a
  <nav>
    element in the
    <footer>
      .
      <!-- the <nav> is not required in the <footer> -->
      <footer>
        <nav>
          <a href="#">...</a>
        </nav>
      </footer>
      <!-- The footer alone is sufficient -->
      <footer>
        <a href="#">...</a>
      </footer>
    </footer>
  </nav>
</footer>
