The
<article>
  element contains self-contained content like articles, blog posts, user
  comments or an interactive widget that could be distributed outside the
  context of the page, for example by RSS. When article elements are nested, the
  contents of the inner article node should be related to the outer article
  element. A blog (section) with multiple posts (article), and comments
  (article) might look something like this.
  <section>
    <!-- Each individual blog post is an <article> -->
    <article>
      <header>
        <h1>Blog Post</h1>
        <time datetime="2016-03-13">13th March 2016</time>
      </header>
      <p>
        The article element represents a self contained article or document.
      </p>
      <p>The section element represents a grouping of content.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Comments <small>relating to "Blog Post"</small></h2>
        <!-- Related comment is also a self-contained article -->
        <article id="user-comment-1">
          <p>Excellent!</p>
          <footer>
            <p>...</p>
            <time>...</time>
          </footer>
        </article>
      </section>
    </article>
    <!-- ./repeat: <article> -->
  </section>
  <!-- Content unrelated to the blog or posts should be outside the section. -->
  <footer>
    <p>This content should be unrelated to the blog.</p>
  </footer>
</article>
