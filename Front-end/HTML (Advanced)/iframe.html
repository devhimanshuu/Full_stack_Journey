The term "IFrame" means Inline Frame. It can be used to include another page in
your page. This will yield a small frame which shows the exact contents of the
base.html.

<iframe src="base.html"></iframe>

<!-- SandBoxing -->
The following embeds an untrusted web page with all restrictions enabled
<iframe sandbox src="http://example.com/"></iframe>
To allow the page to run scripts and submit forms, add allow-scripts and
allow-forms to the sandbox attribute.
<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms" src="http://example.com/"></iframe>
If there is untrusted content (such as user comments) on the same domain as the
parent web page, an iframe can be used to disable scripts while still allowing
the parent document to interact with it's content using JavaScript.
<iframe
  sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-top-navigation"
  src="http://example.com/untrusted/comments/page2"
>
</iframe>

<!-- srcdoc -->
The srcdoc attribute can be used (instead of the src attribute) to specify the
exact contents of the iframe as a whole HTML document. This will yield an IFrame
with the text "IFrames are cool!"
<iframe srcdoc="<p>IFrames are cool!</p>"></iframe>
If the srcdoc attribute isn't supported by the browser, the IFrame will instead
fall back to using the src attribute, but if both the src and srcdoc attributes
are present and supported by the browser, srcdoc takes precedence.
<iframe srcdoc="<p>Iframes are cool!</p>" src="base.html"></iframe>
