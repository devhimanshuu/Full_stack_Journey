The
<progress>
  element is new in HTML5 and is used to represent the progress of a task
  <progress value="22" max="100"></progress>
  This creates a bar filled 22%
</progress>
Chrome / Safari / Opera These browsers use the -webkit-appearance selector to
style the progress tag. To override this, we can reset the appearance.
progress[value] { -webkit-appearance: none; appearance: none; }
