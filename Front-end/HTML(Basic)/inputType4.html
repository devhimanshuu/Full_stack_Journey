<input type="file" name="fileSubmission" />
File inputs allow users to select a file from their local filesystem for use
with the current page. If used in conjunction with a form element, they can be
used to allow users to upload files to a server (for more info see Uploading
Files). The following example allows users to use the file input to select a
file from their filesystem and upload that file to a script on the server named
upload_file.php.

<form action="upload_file.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  Select file to upload:
  <input type="file" name="fileSubmission" id="fileSubmission" />
  <input type="submit" value="Upload your file" name="submit" />
</form>

Multiple files Adding the multiple attribute the user will be able to select
more than one file:

<input type="file" name="fileSubmission" id="fileSubmission" multiple />
Accept Files Accept attribute specifies the types of files that user can select.
E.g. .png, .gif, .jpeg.
<input
  type="file"
  name="fileSubmission"
  accept="image/x-png,image/gif,image/jpeg"
/>
