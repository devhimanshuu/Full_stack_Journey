The preconnect relationship is similar to dns-prefetch in that it will resolve
the DNS. However, it will also make the TCP handshake, and optional TLS
negotiation. This is an experimental feature.
<link rel="preconnect" href="URL" />
DNS-Prefetch Informs browsers to resolve the DNS for a URL, so that all assets
from that URL load faster.
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="URL" />
Prefetch Informs the browsers that a given resource should be prefetched so it
can be loaded more quickly.
<link rel="prefetch" href="URL" />
DNS-Prefetch resolves only the domain name whereas prefetch downloads/stores the
specified resources. Prerender Informs browsers to fetch and render the URL in
the background, so that they can be delivered to the user instantaneously as the
user navigates to that URL. This is an experimental feature.
<link rel="prerender" href="URL" />

<link rel="stylesheet" href="test.css" media="print" />
Media specifies what style sheet should be used for what type of media. Using
the print value would only display that style sheet for print pages. The value
of this attribute can be any of the mediatype values (similar to a CSS media
query). When a page is part of a series of articles, for instance, one can use
prev and next to point to pages that are coming before and after.
<link rel="prev" href="http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/java/topics" />
<link rel="next" href="http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/css/topics" />

Use the rel="alternate" attribute to allow discoverability of your Atom/RSS
feeds.
<link
  rel="alternate"
  type="application/atom+xml"
  href="http://example.com/feed.xml"
/>
<link
  rel="alternate"
  type="application/rss+xml"
  href="http://example.com/feed.xml"
/>
