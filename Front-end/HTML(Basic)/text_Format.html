    <!-- The <mark> element is new in HTML5 and is used to mark or highlight text in a document "due to its relevance in
another context" -->
    <p>
      Here is some content from an article that contains the
      <mark>searched query</mark> that we are looking for. Highlighting the text
      will make it easier for the user to find what they are looking for.
    </p>
    <!-- To bold text, use the <strong> or <b> tags:
 -->
    <strong>Bold Text Here</strong>
    or
    <b>Bold Text Here</b>
    <!-- Whatâ€™s the difference? Semantics. <strong> is used to indicate that the text is fundamentally or semantically
important to the surrounding text, while <b> indicates no such importance and simply represents text that should
be bolded.
 -->

    <!-- To italicize text, use the <em> or <i> tags -->
    <em>Italicized Text Here</em>
    or
    <i>Italicized Text Here</i>

    <!-- To mark some expression as an abbreviation, use <abbr> tag: -->
    <p>I like to write <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>!</p>
    <!-- If present, the title attribute is used to present the full description of such abbreviation. -->

    <!-- Underlined Text
While the <u> element itself was deprecated in HTMl 4, it was reintroduced with alternate semantic meaning in
HTML 5 - to represent an unarticulated, non-textual annotation. You might use such a rendering to indicate
misspelled text on the page, or for a Chinese proper name mark. -->
    <p>This paragraph contains some <u>mispelled</u> text.</p>
