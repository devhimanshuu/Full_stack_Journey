<input type="button" value="Button Text" />
Buttons can be used for triggering actions to occur on the page, without
submitting the form. You can also use the
<button>
  element if you require a button that can be more easily styled or contain
  other elements:
  <button type="button">Button Text</button>
  Buttons are typically used with an "onclick" event:
  <input type="button" onclick="alert('hello world!')" value="Click Me" />
  or
  <button type="button" onclick="alert('hello world!')">Click Me</button>
</button>

<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
A submit input creates a button which submits the form it is inside when
clicked. You can also use the
<button>
  element if you require a submit button that can be more easily styled or
  contain other elements:
  <button type="submit"><img src="submit-icon.jpg" /> Submit</button>
</button>

<input type="hidden" name="inputName" value="inputValue" />
A hidden input won't be visible to the user, but its value will be sent to the
server when the form is submitted nonetheless.

<input type="tel" value="+8400000000" />
The input element with a type attribute whose value is tel represents a one-line
plain-text edit control for entering a telephone number



The <input type="email"> is used for input fields that should contain an e-mail address.
<form>
 <label>E-mail: <label>
 <input type="email" name="email">
</form>
E-mail address can be automatically validated when submitted depending on browser support.
