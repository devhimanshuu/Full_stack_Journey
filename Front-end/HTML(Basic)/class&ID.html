    <!-- Classes are identifiers for the elements that they are assigned to. Use the
    class attribute to assign a class to an element. -->
    <div class="example-class"></div>
    <!-- To assign multiple classes to an element, separate the class names with
    spaces. -->
    <div class="class1 class2"></div>
    <!-- Using classes in CSS Classes can be used for styling certain elements
    without changing all elements of that kind. For example, these two span
    elements can have completely different stylings: -->
    <span></span>
    <span class="special"></span>
    <!-- Classes of the same name can be given to any number of elements on a page
    and they will all receive the styling associated with that class. This will
    always be true unless you specify the element within the CSS. For example,
    we have two elements, both with the class highlight: -->
    <div class="highlight">Lorem ipsum</div>
    <span class="highlight">Lorem ipsum</span>

    <!-- If our CSS is as below, then the color green will be applied to the text
    within both elements: .highlight { color: green; } However, if we only want
    to target div's with the class highlight then we can add specificity like
    below: div.highlight { color: green; } -->

    <!-- The ID attribute of an element is an identifier which must be unique in the
    whole document. Its purpose is to uniquely identify the element when linking
    (using an anchor), scripting, or styling (with CSS). -->
    <div id="example-id"></div>
    <!-- You should not have two elements with the same ID in the same document, even
    if the attributes are attached to two different kinds of elements. For
    example, the following code is incorrect: -->
    <div id="example-id"></div>
    <span id="example-id"></span>
    <!-- Browsers will do their best to render this code, but unexpected behavior may
    occur when styling with CSS or adding functionality with JavaScript. To
    reference elements by their ID in CSS, prefix the ID with #. #example-id {
    color: green; } To jump to an element with an ID on a given page, append #
    with the element name in the URL. http://example.com/about#example-id This
    feature is supported in most browsers and does not require additional
    JavaScript or CSS to work. -->
