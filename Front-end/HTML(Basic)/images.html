<!-- Alt-text is used by screen readers for visually impaired users and by search
engines. It's therefore important to write good alt-text for your images. The
text should look correct even if you replace the image with its alt attribute.
For example: -->

<!-- Incorrect -->
<img src="anonymous.png" alt="Anonymous user avatar" /> An anonymous user wrote:
<blockquote>Lorem ipsum dolor sed.</blockquote>
<a href="https://google.com/"><img src="edit.png" alt="Edit icon" /></a> /
<a href="https://google.com/"><img src="delete.png" alt="Delete icon" /></a>

<!-- Remove the alt-text for the avatar. This image adds information for sighted users (an easily identifiable icon
to show that the user is anonymous) but this information is already available in the text.1
Remove the "icon" from the alt-text for the icons. Knowing that this would be an icon if it were there does not
help to convey its actual purpose. -->

<!-- Correct -->
<img src="anonymous.png" alt="" /> An anonymous user wrote:
<blockquote>Lorem ipsum dolor sed.</blockquote>
<a href="https://google.com/"><img src="edit.png" alt="Edit" /></a> /
<a href="https://google.com/"><img src="delete.png" alt="Delete" /></a>
