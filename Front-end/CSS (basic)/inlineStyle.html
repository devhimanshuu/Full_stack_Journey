<!-- Use inline styles to apply styling to a specific element. Note that this is not optimal. Placing style rules in a <style>
    tag or external CSS file is encouraged in order to maintain a distinction between content and presentation.
    Inline styles override any CSS in a <style> tag or external style sheet. While this can be useful in some
    circumstances, this fact more often than not reduces a project's maintainability. -->
