// Using $match and $group Stages in a MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline
// Review the following sections, which show the code for the $match and $group aggregation stages.

// $match
// The $match stage filters for documents that match specified conditions. Here's the code for $match:

{
  $match: {
    field_name: "value";
  }
}
$group;
// The $group stage groups documents by a group key.

// {
//   $group:
//     {
//       _id: <expression>, // Group key
//       <field>: { <accumulator> : <expression> }
//     }
//  }

  /* $match and $group in an Aggregation Pipeline
