// Create a Compound Index
// Use createIndex() to create a new index in a collection. Within the parentheses of createIndex(), include an object that contains two or more fields and their sort order.

db.customers.createIndex({
  active: 1,
  birthdate: -1,
  name: 1,
});

// Order of Fields in a Compound Index
// The order of the fields matters when creating the index and the sort order. It is recommended to list the fields in the following order: Equality, Sort, and Range.

// Equality: field/s that matches on a single field value in a query
// Sort: field/s that orders the results by in a query
// Range: field/s that the query filter in a range of valid values
// The following query includes an equality match on the active field, a sort on birthday (descending) and name (ascending), and a range query on birthday too.

db.customers
  .find({
    birthdate: {
      $gte: ISODate("1977-01-01"),
    },
    active: true,
  })
  .sort({
    birthdate: -1,
    name: 1,
  });
// Here's an example of an efficient index for this query:

db.customers.createIndex({
  active: 1,
  birthdate: -1,
  name: 1,
});

// View the Indexes used in a Collection
// Use getIndexes() to see all the indexes created in a collection.

db.customers.getIndexes();

// Check if an index is being used on a query
// Use explain() in a collection when running a query to see the Execution plan. This plan provides the details of the execution stages (IXSCAN , COLLSCAN, FETCH, SORT, etc.). Some of these are:

// The IXSCAN stage indicates the query is using an index and what index is being selected.
// The COLLSCAN stage indicates a collection scan is perform, not using any indexes.
// The FETCH stage indicates documents are being read from the collection.
// The SORT stage indicates documents are being sorted in memory.
db.customers
  .explain()
  .find({
    birthdate: {
      $gte: ISODate("1977-01-01"),
    },
    active: true,
  })
  .sort({
    birthdate: -1,
    name: 1,
  });

// Cover a query by the Index
// An Index covers a query when MongoDB does not need to fetch the data from memory since all the required data is already returned by the index.

// In most cases, we can use projections to return only the required fields and cover the query. Make sure those fields in the projection are in the index.

// By adding the projection {name:1,birthdate:1,_id:0} in the previous query, we can limit the returned fields to only name and birthdate. These fields are part of the index and when we run the explain() command, the execution plan shows only two stages:

// IXSCAN - Index scan using the compound index
// PROJECTION_COVERED - All the information needed is returned by the index, no need to fetch from memory
